## Achievement Types (Frontend Implementation)

The backend returns just the achievement name strings. The frontend should implement a comprehensive enum:

```javascript
const ACHIEVEMENTS = {
  first_game: {
    name: "First Game",
    description: "Play your first game",
    icon: "üéÆ",
    rarity: "common",
  },
  first_win: {
    name: "First Victory",
    description: "Win your first game",
    icon: "üèÜ",
    rarity: "common",
  },
  win_streak_5: {
    name: "Streak Master",
    description: "Win 5 games in a row",
    icon: "üî•",
    rarity: "rare",
  },
  win_streak_10: {
    name: "Unstoppable",
    description: "Win 10 games in a row",
    icon: "‚ö°",
    rarity: "epic",
  },
  score_1000: {
    name: "Rising Star",
    description: "Score 1,000 points",
    icon: "‚≠ê",
    rarity: "common",
  },
  score_5000: {
    name: "High Scorer",
    description: "Score 5,000 points",
    icon: "üåü",
    rarity: "rare",
  },
  score_10000: {
    name: "Score Legend",

    name: "Line Legend",
    description: "Clear 1,000 lines",
    icon: "üëë",

  },

    icon: "üìà",
    rarity: "common",
  },
  level_25: {
    name: "Expert Player",
    description: "Reach level 25",
    icon: "üéì",
    rarity: "rare",
  },
  level_50: {
    name: "Tetris Master",
    description: "Reach level 50",
    icon: "üë®‚Äçüéì",
    rarity: "legendary",
  },
};
```

## Example Frontend Integration

### Get comprehensive profile data:

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/api/users/me/profile", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
const profileData = await response.json();

// Use profileData.data to populate profile page
console.log(`Welcome ${profileData.data.username}!`);
console.log(
  `Level ${profileData.data.stats.level} ${profileData.data.performance.skillLevel}`
);
console.log(`${profileData.data.totalAchievements} achievements unlocked`);
```

### Complete a game:

```javascript
const gameResult = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}/complete-game`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    score: 1500,
    lines: 15,
    duration: 120,
    result: "win",
  }),
});
```

### Get leaderboard (no auth required):

```javascript
const leaderboard = await fetch("/api/users/leaderboard?limit=10");
const data = await leaderboard.json();
```
